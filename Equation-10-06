# Equation 10-06 Implementation

## Overview
This section provides a detailed implementation and explanation of the equation 10-06 from the field of Econophysics. The equation is implemented in Python, and this documentation aims to guide users through its usage.

## Equation
The equation is defined as follows:

\[ \frac{\partial F_A}{F_A} + \frac{\partial V}{V} = \frac{\partial U_P}{U_P} \]

## Python Implementation
```python
import sympy as sp

def equation_10_06(F_A, V, U_P, x):
    """
    Implement the equation 10-06: (∂F_A/F_A) + (∂V/V) = (∂U_P/U_P)

    Parameters:
    F_A (sp.Expr): Expression for F_A as a function of x
    V (sp.Expr): Expression for V as a function of x
    U_P (sp.Expr): Expression for U_P as a function of x
    x (sp.Symbol): The variable with respect to which the partial derivatives are taken

    Returns:
    bool: True if the equation holds, False otherwise
    """
    # Calculate the partial derivatives
    partial_F_A = sp.diff(F_A, x) / F_A
    partial_V = sp.diff(V, x) / V
    partial_U_P = sp.diff(U_P, x) / U_P

    # Check if the equation holds
    return sp.simplify(partial_F_A + partial_V - partial_U_P) == 0
