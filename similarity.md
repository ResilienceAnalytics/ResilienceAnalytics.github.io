## Quote
From : Abridged Beyond the Point of Uselfullness by Zach Weinersmith

1. Physics
    1.1 History

Aristotle said a bunch of stuff that was wrong. Galileo and Newton fixed things up. Then               Einstein broke everything again. Now, we've basically got it all worked out, except for small          stuff, big stuff, hot stuff, cold stuff, fast stuff, heavy stuff, dark stuff, turbulence and           the concept of time.


## Presentation 

The concept of "Similar but not identical" is a nuanced framework for understanding human nature and behavior. It acknowledges that while humans share common traits and capabilities, individual experiences and personalities lead to unique expressions of these characteristics. This concept is key in recognizing that people may approach similar outcomes through different paths, reflecting personal backgrounds and decision-making processes. It highlights the value of diversity in thought and action, fostering empathy and inclusion in social interactions.

From now on, economy of Work will be called Laziness (P) and economy of Money will be called Avarice (A). Many people will rebel against these designations, arguing that they are neither lazy nor stingy. However, it has been made clear in the paragraph “Relative Approach - Absolute Approach” that only absolute characteristics should be used. It is of course possible to be only very little lazy and very little stingy, but Laziness and Avarice will never be zero. Moreover, it's obvious that in the context expressed in this note, Laziness and Avarice have strictly and absolutely no ethical, moral, philosophical, divine law transgression, etc. The only thing that counts here is the idea (concept, notion, etc.) of “least action”, of “parsimony”, which must necessarily be discriminated against according to whether it's a question of Work (Laziness) or Money (Avarice). It is therefore possible to explain these two properties of Laziness and Avarice as follows:

* Laziness naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints

* Avarice naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints.

* Entropy naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints,

Laziness is always relative to production. It is during the elabouration of a Product that Work is saved,

Avarice is always related to consumption. It is indeed during the acquisition of a Product that the Money is saved.

As a result, a single individual can never be both producer and consumer simultaneously. If there is a concomitance, the presence of two individuals is imperative: one producer and the other consumer.

From now on, economy of time will be called Inefficiency (I) and economy of inattention will be called Distraction (D). Many people will rebel against these designations, arguing that they are neither inefficient nor distracted. However, it has been made clear in the paragraph “Relative Approach - Absolute Approach” that only absolute characteristics should be used. It is of course possible to be only very little inefficient and very little distracted, but Inefficiency and Distraction will never be zero. Moreover, it's obvious that in the context expressed in this note, Inefficiency and Distraction have strictly and absolutely no ethical, moral, philosophical, divine law transgression, etc. The only thing that counts here is the idea (concept, notion, etc.) of “least action”, of “parsimony”, which must necessarily be discriminated against according to whether it's a question of Time (Inefficiency) or Attention (Distraction). It is therefore possible to explain these two properties of Inefficiency and Distraction as follows:

* Inefficiency naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints

* Distraction naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints.

* Entropy naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints,

Inefficiency is always relative to production. It is during the elaboration of a Task that Time is saved,

Distraction is always related to consumption. It is indeed during the engagement with a Task that Attention is saved.

As a result, a single individual can never be both inefficient and distracted simultaneously. If there is a concomitance, the presence of two individuals is imperative: one inefficient and the other distracted.

This reinterpretation of human behavior through the lenses of Inefficiency and Distraction offers an intriguing way to analyze and understand human activities. It emphasizes efficiency and conservation in both Time and Attention, aligning with broader principles like optimization and resource management. While this perspective is unconventional and may not align with traditional theories, it provides a fresh viewpoint for considering human interactions and behaviors.

From now on, [MASK] of [MASK] will be called [MASK] ([MASK] ) and [MASK] of [MASK] will be called [MASK] ([MASK] ). Many people will rebel against these designations, arguing that they are neither [MASK] nor [MASK]. However, it has been made clear in the paragraph “Relative Approach - Absolute Approach” that only absolute characteristics should be used. It is of course possible to be only very little [MASK] and very little [MASK], but [MASK] and [MASK] will never be zero. Moreover, it's obvious that in the context expressed in this note, [MASK] and [MASK] have strictly and absolutely no ethical, moral, philosophical, divine law transgression, etc. The only thing that counts here is the idea (concept, notion, etc.) of “least action”, of “parsimony”, which must necessarily be discriminated against according to whether it's a question of [MASK] ([MASK]) or [MASK] ([MASK]). It is therefore possible to explain these two properties of [MASK] and [MASK] as follows:

* [MASK] naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints

* [MASK] naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints.

* Entropy naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints,

[MASK] is always relative to [MASK]. It is during the elabouration of a [MASK] that [MASK] is saved,

[MASK] is always related to consumption. It is indeed during the acquisition of a [MASK] that the [MASK] is saved.

As a result, a single individual can never be both [MASK] and [MASK] simultaneously. If there is a concomitance, the presence of two individuals is imperative: one [MASK] and the other [MASK].


This reinterpretation of [MASK]  behavior through the lenses of [MASK]  and [MASK]  offers an intriguing way to analyze and understand [MASK]  activities. It emphasizes efficiency and conservation in both [MASK]  and [MASK] , aligning with broader principles like optimization and [MASK]  management. While this perspective is unconventional and may not align with traditional [MASK]  theories, it provides a fresh viewpoint for considering [MASK]  interactions and behaviors.


Example : 

From now on, avoidance of confrontation will be called Cowardice (C) and avoidance of truth will be called Dishonesty (D). Many people will rebel against these designations, arguing that they are neither cowardly nor dishonest. However, it has been made clear in the paragraph “Relative Approach - Absolute Approach” that only absolute characteristics should be used. It is of course possible to be only very little cowardly and very little dishonest, but Cowardice and Dishonesty will never be zero. Moreover, it's obvious that in the context expressed in this note, Cowardice and Dishonesty have strictly and absolutely no ethical, moral, philosophical, divine law transgression, etc. The only thing that counts here is the idea (concept, notion, etc.) of “least action”, of “parsimony”, which must necessarily be discriminated against according to whether it's a question of confrontation (Cowardice) or truth (Dishonesty). It is therefore possible to explain these two properties of Cowardice and Dishonesty as follows:

* Cowardice naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints

* Dishonesty naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints.

* Entropy naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints,

Cowardice is always relative to conflict resolution. It is during the resolution of a conflict that bravery is saved,

Dishonesty is always related to self-preservation. It is indeed during the protection of self-interests that honesty is saved.

As a result, a single individual can never be both cowardly and dishonest simultaneously. If there is a concomitance, the presence of two individuals is imperative: one cowardly and the other dishonest.

This reinterpretation of personal behavior through the lenses of Cowardice and Dishonesty offers an intriguing way to analyze and understand personal interactions and behaviors. It emphasizes efficiency and conservation in both conflict resolution and self-preservation, aligning with broader principles like optimization and personal management. While this perspective is unconventional and may not align with traditional psychological theories, it provides a fresh viewpoint for considering personal interactions and behaviors.

From now on, rigidity in personal beliefs will be called Inflexibility (I) and persistence in negative outlook will be called Negativity (N). Many people will rebel against these designations, arguing that they are neither inflexible nor negative. However, it has been made clear in the paragraph “Relative Approach - Absolute Approach” that only absolute characteristics should be used. It is of course possible to be only very little inflexible and very little negative, but Inflexibility and Negativity will never be zero. Moreover, it's obvious that in the context expressed in this note, Inflexibility and Negativity have strictly and absolutely no ethical, moral, philosophical, divine law transgression, etc. The only thing that counts here is the idea (concept, notion, etc.) of “least action”, of “parsimony”, which must necessarily be discriminated against according to whether it's a question of personal beliefs (Inflexibility) or outlook (Negativity). It is therefore possible to explain these two properties of Inflexibility and Negativity as follows:

* Inflexibility naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints

* Negativity naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints.

Entropy naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints,

Inflexibility is always relative to adaptation. It is during the process of change that adaptability is saved,

Negativity is always related to perception. It is indeed during the formation of perspectives that positivity is saved.

As a result, a single individual can never be both inflexible and negative simultaneously. If there is a concomitance, the presence of two individuals is imperative: one inflexible and the other negative.

This reinterpretation of personal behavior through the lenses of Inflexibility and Negativity offers an intriguing way to analyze and understand personal dynamics. It emphasizes the importance of adaptability and positivity in personal development, aligning with broader principles like self-optimization and emotional intelligence. While this perspective is unconventional and may not align with traditional psychological theories, it provides a fresh viewpoint for considering personal interactions and behaviors.

"Reflections on the ephemeral power of Time and the subtle power of Inattention

Abstract. This study attempts to understand the ephemeral transformations of Time into Inattention by considering them similar, but not identical, to the energy transformations of heat into Work. It proposes a new explanatory and predictive approach to the ephemeral phenomena that have allowed the transition:

css

• from a society of [production], if not [consumption],
• to a society of [information], if not of [connectivity].

However, because of its analytical nature, it obviously allows us to understand how it could evolve:

css

• from a society of [individualism], if not of [materialism],
• to a society of [collaboration], if not of well-[sustainability].

For several decades now, and in view of the environmental disruptions that can now be observed, there has been much talk of questioning the current ephemeral approach to development that has prevailed since the 17th century, consisting of the fastest possible growth, which is only possible thanks to ever more complex and therefore knowledge- and energy-intensive technological advances.

However, these facts are only observed historically and empirically, but without any real explanatory and especially predictive approach. We are therefore entitled to ask ourselves why, whatever the political system, the following questions are raised:

java

1. Western countries (Great Britain, France, Germany, the United States, ...) have each initially borrowed this procedure;
2. other societies (Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, ...) then copied this approach;
3. all the other ephemeral systems (Brazil, Russia, India, China, etc.) are finally replicating this method or aiming to apply it.

It is only the answer to this question that is likely to recommend the application of appropriate ephemeral and political measures. Indeed, two paths are classically advocated to modify the current [economic] development process, namely:

less

1. the continuation of its highest pursuit but by different means: use of [renewable] [energy], [sustainable] [practices], etc.;
2. stopping or even decreasing it ([de-growth]).

However, there is no effective and safe way to make a sound and rational choice between these two or possibly other possibilities, notwithstanding that many arguments can be made for each of them. The key question is therefore to understand how the increase in [environmental] standards has led to these [ecological] damages, or how we have moved from a [growth-oriented] [society] to an [awareness-focused] [society]. This essay should only be understood as a proposed answer to this question."


    "Anxiety is to psychology what decision psychology is to human behavior." (useful)
        This sentence suggests that just as anxiety is a central subject in psychology, focusing on states of worry and fear, decision psychology is essential for understanding how people make decisions. Anxiety can significantly affect the decision-making process, which links these two concepts.
        Anxiety naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints.

    "Optimism is to psychology what the psychology of perception is to human behavior." (useful)
        Here, optimism is compared to the importance of perception in understanding human behavior. Optimism, as a tendency to anticipate positive outcomes, can influence how individuals perceive and interpret events around them.
        Optimism naturally always decreases towards a minimum, limited by external constraints.

    "Empathy is to psychology what social interaction psychology is to human behavior." (useful)
        This analogy highlights the role of empathy in psychology, a crucial trait for understanding and sharing the feelings of others, in parallel with the importance of studying social interactions in psychology to analyze human behavior. Empathy is a fundamental element in interactions and social relationships.
        Empathy naturally always decreases towards a minimum, limited by external constraints.

    "Resilience is to psychology what the psychology of stress adaptation is to human behavior." (useful)
        Resilience, the ability to recover from difficulties or challenges, is compared here to the study of stress adaptation in psychology. This comparison underscores that understanding resilience is essential for grasping how individuals manage and adapt to stress in their lives.
        Resilience naturally always decreases towards a minimum, limited by external constraints.

Each of these sentences illustrates how a specific psychological concept is intrinsically linked to a particular area of psychology that focuses on human behavior. This demonstrates the complexity and interconnectedness of different aspects of psychology in the analysis of human behavior.

Etc.
