The concept of "Similar but not identical" is a nuanced framework for understanding human nature and behavior. It acknowledges that while humans share common traits and capabilities, individual experiences and personalities lead to unique expressions of these characteristics. This concept is key in recognizing that people may approach similar outcomes through different paths, reflecting personal backgrounds and decision-making processes. It highlights the value of diversity in thought and action, fostering empathy and inclusion in social interactions.

From now on, economy of Work will be called Laziness (P) and economy of Money will be called Avarice (A). Many people will rebel against these designations, arguing that they are neither lazy nor stingy. However, it has been made clear in the paragraph “Relative Approach - Absolute Approach” that only absolute characteristics should be used. It is of course possible to be only very little lazy and very little stingy, but Laziness and Avarice will never be zero. Moreover, it's obvious that in the context expressed in this note, Laziness and Avarice have strictly and absolutely no ethical, moral, philosophical, divine law transgression, etc. The only thing that counts here is the idea (concept, notion, etc.) of “least action”, of “parsimony”, which must necessarily be discriminated against according to whether it's a question of Work (Laziness) or Money (Avarice). It is therefore possible to explain these two properties of Laziness and Avarice as follows:

* Laziness naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints

* Avarice naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints.

* Entropy naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints,

Laziness is always relative to production. It is during the elabouration of a Product that Work is saved,

Avarice is always related to consumption. It is indeed during the acquisition of a Product that the Money is saved.

As a result, a single individual can never be both producer and consumer simultaneously. If there is a concomitance, the presence of two individuals is imperative: one producer and the other consumer.

From now on, economy of time will be called Inefficiency (I) and economy of inattention will be called Distraction (D). Many people will rebel against these designations, arguing that they are neither inefficient nor distracted. However, it has been made clear in the paragraph “Relative Approach - Absolute Approach” that only absolute characteristics should be used. It is of course possible to be only very little inefficient and very little distracted, but Inefficiency and Distraction will never be zero. Moreover, it's obvious that in the context expressed in this note, Inefficiency and Distraction have strictly and absolutely no ethical, moral, philosophical, divine law transgression, etc. The only thing that counts here is the idea (concept, notion, etc.) of “least action”, of “parsimony”, which must necessarily be discriminated against according to whether it's a question of Time (Inefficiency) or Attention (Distraction). It is therefore possible to explain these two properties of Inefficiency and Distraction as follows:

* Inefficiency naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints

* Distraction naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints.

* Entropy naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints,

Inefficiency is always relative to production. It is during the elaboration of a Task that Time is saved,

Distraction is always related to consumption. It is indeed during the engagement with a Task that Attention is saved.

As a result, a single individual can never be both inefficient and distracted simultaneously. If there is a concomitance, the presence of two individuals is imperative: one inefficient and the other distracted.

This reinterpretation of human behavior through the lenses of Inefficiency and Distraction offers an intriguing way to analyze and understand human activities. It emphasizes efficiency and conservation in both Time and Attention, aligning with broader principles like optimization and resource management. While this perspective is unconventional and may not align with traditional theories, it provides a fresh viewpoint for considering human interactions and behaviors.

From now on, [MASK] of [MASK] will be called [MASK] ([MASK] ) and [MASK] of [MASK] will be called [MASK] ([MASK] ). Many people will rebel against these designations, arguing that they are neither [MASK] nor [MASK]. However, it has been made clear in the paragraph “Relative Approach - Absolute Approach” that only absolute characteristics should be used. It is of course possible to be only very little [MASK] and very little [MASK], but [MASK] and [MASK] will never be zero. Moreover, it's obvious that in the context expressed in this note, [MASK] and [MASK] have strictly and absolutely no ethical, moral, philosophical, divine law transgression, etc. The only thing that counts here is the idea (concept, notion, etc.) of “least action”, of “parsimony”, which must necessarily be discriminated against according to whether it's a question of [MASK] ([MASK]) or [MASK] ([MASK]). It is therefore possible to explain these two properties of [MASK] and [MASK] as follows:

* [MASK] naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints

* [MASK] naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints.

* Entropy naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints,

[MASK] is always relative to [MASK]ion. It is during the elabouration of a [MASK] that [MASK] is saved,

[MASK] is always related to consumption. It is indeed during the acquisition of a [MASK] that the [MASK] is saved.

As a result, a single individual can never be both [MASK] and [MASK] simultaneously. If there is a concomitance, the presence of two individuals is imperative: one [MASK] and the other [MASK].


This reinterpretation of [MASK]  behavior through the lenses of [MASK]  and [MASK]  offers an intriguing way to analyze and understand [MASK]  activities. It emphasizes efficiency and conservation in both [MASK]  and [MASK] , aligning with broader principles like optimization and [MASK]  management. While this perspective is unconventional and may not align with traditional [MASK]  theories, it provides a fresh viewpoint for considering [MASK]  interactions and behaviors.


Example : 

From now on, avoidance of confrontation will be called Cowardice (C) and avoidance of truth will be called Dishonesty (D). Many people will rebel against these designations, arguing that they are neither cowardly nor dishonest. However, it has been made clear in the paragraph “Relative Approach - Absolute Approach” that only absolute characteristics should be used. It is of course possible to be only very little cowardly and very little dishonest, but Cowardice and Dishonesty will never be zero. Moreover, it's obvious that in the context expressed in this note, Cowardice and Dishonesty have strictly and absolutely no ethical, moral, philosophical, divine law transgression, etc. The only thing that counts here is the idea (concept, notion, etc.) of “least action”, of “parsimony”, which must necessarily be discriminated against according to whether it's a question of confrontation (Cowardice) or truth (Dishonesty). It is therefore possible to explain these two properties of Cowardice and Dishonesty as follows:

* Cowardice naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints

* Dishonesty naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints.

* Entropy naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints,

Cowardice is always relative to conflict resolution. It is during the resolution of a conflict that bravery is saved,

Dishonesty is always related to self-preservation. It is indeed during the protection of self-interests that honesty is saved.

As a result, a single individual can never be both cowardly and dishonest simultaneously. If there is a concomitance, the presence of two individuals is imperative: one cowardly and the other dishonest.

This reinterpretation of personal behavior through the lenses of Cowardice and Dishonesty offers an intriguing way to analyze and understand personal interactions and behaviors. It emphasizes efficiency and conservation in both conflict resolution and self-preservation, aligning with broader principles like optimization and personal management. While this perspective is unconventional and may not align with traditional psychological theories, it provides a fresh viewpoint for considering personal interactions and behaviors.

From now on, rigidity in personal beliefs will be called Inflexibility (I) and persistence in negative outlook will be called Negativity (N). Many people will rebel against these designations, arguing that they are neither inflexible nor negative. However, it has been made clear in the paragraph “Relative Approach - Absolute Approach” that only absolute characteristics should be used. It is of course possible to be only very little inflexible and very little negative, but Inflexibility and Negativity will never be zero. Moreover, it's obvious that in the context expressed in this note, Inflexibility and Negativity have strictly and absolutely no ethical, moral, philosophical, divine law transgression, etc. The only thing that counts here is the idea (concept, notion, etc.) of “least action”, of “parsimony”, which must necessarily be discriminated against according to whether it's a question of personal beliefs (Inflexibility) or outlook (Negativity). It is therefore possible to explain these two properties of Inflexibility and Negativity as follows:

* Inflexibility naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints

* Negativity naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints.

Entropy naturally always increases towards a maximum, limited by external constraints,

Inflexibility is always relative to adaptation. It is during the process of change that adaptability is saved,

Negativity is always related to perception. It is indeed during the formation of perspectives that positivity is saved.

As a result, a single individual can never be both inflexible and negative simultaneously. If there is a concomitance, the presence of two individuals is imperative: one inflexible and the other negative.

This reinterpretation of personal behavior through the lenses of Inflexibility and Negativity offers an intriguing way to analyze and understand personal dynamics. It emphasizes the importance of adaptability and positivity in personal development, aligning with broader principles like self-optimization and emotional intelligence. While this perspective is unconventional and may not align with traditional psychological theories, it provides a fresh viewpoint for considering personal interactions and behaviors.
