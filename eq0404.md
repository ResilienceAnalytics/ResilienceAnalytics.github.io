# Equation 04-04 Implementation
## Overview

This section provides a detailed implementation and explanation of the equation 04-04 from the field of Physics. The equation describes the relationship between angular acceleration, angular velocity, and the second derivative of position. This documentation aims to guide users through its usage.
## Equation

The equation is defined as follows:
γϖ=dϖdt=d2pdt2
γϖ​=dtdϖ​=dt2d2p​
## Python Implementation

    def eq0404(d_varpi, dt, d2p):
    
    Calculate gamma_varpi based on the equation gamma_varpi = d(varpi)/dt = d^2(p)/dt^2

    Parameters:
    d_varpi (float): The change in angular velocity
    dt (float): The change in time
    d2p (float): The second derivative of position with respect to time

    Returns:
    float: The calculated value of gamma_varpi
    
    if dt == 0:
        raise ValueError("dt cannot be 0 as it would result in division by zero.")
    gamma_varpi = d_varpi / dt
    if gamma_varpi != d2p:
        raise ValueError("The equation does not hold as gamma_varpi is not equal to d^2(p)/dt^2.")
    return gamma_varpi

## Usage

To use the eq0404 function, you need to provide the values of d_varpi (change in angular velocity), dt (change in time), and d2p (second derivative of position with respect to time) as arguments. The function will then calculate and return the value of γϖγϖ​.
## Example


  d_varpi_value = 10  # replace with your value
  dt_value = 2        # replace with your value
  d2p_value = 5       # replace with your value
  result = eq0404(d_varpi_value, dt_value, d2p_value)
  print("The calculated value of gamma_varpi is:", result)

In this example, we have defined d_varpi as 10, dt as 2, and d2p as 5. The function eq0404 calculates the value of γϖγϖ​ based on the equation γϖ=dϖdt=d2pdt2γϖ​=dtdϖ​=dt2d2p​, and the result is printed to the console.
