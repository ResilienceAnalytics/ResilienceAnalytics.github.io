## Welcome to Resilience Analytics

Resilience Analytics is a company dedicated to integrative analysis of sustainable and resilient development. Our goal is to balance economic growth, social equity, and environmental preservation through a transdisciplinary approach.

### Research Project

Explore our research project that explores the intersections between economics, thermodynamics, blockchain technologies, and monetary policies. Our transversal approach aims to provide policy recommendations based on in-depth analysis.

### Econophysics

Delve into our Econophysics section where we apply the formalism of thermodynamics to economics. Discover how thermodynamic principles can bring new perspectives to economic analysis and sustainability.

### Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool

We chose a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) over an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) to ensure fair distribution, enable organic price discovery, and establish initial market liquidity for our project.

### Digital Currency

This project aims to create a decentralized currency based on the digital euro model, with the objective of increasing wealth in the economic system through transparency, inclusivity, and sustainable practices.
