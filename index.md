## Ongoing Updates

Welcome to the Resilience Analytics website, a fusion of innovation, humor, and science.

Our inspiration stems from Zach Weinersmith's work, "Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness," which addresses the history of physics in a light-hearted and critical manner. This approach is reflected in our examination of the humanities and social sciences through the lens of natural sciences. We challenge traditional distinctions made by the human mind, often colored by biases and historical influences.

As humorously pointed out by Weinersmith, many scientific fields have undergone advancements and revisions: "Aristotle said a lot of things that were wrong. Galileo and Newton fixed things up. Then Einstein broke everything again. Today, we've basically got it all worked out, except for small stuff, big stuff, hot stuff, cold stuff, fast stuff, heavy stuff, dark stuff, turbulence, and the concept of time."

Our approach, detailed on [this page](https://resilienceanalytics.github.io/similarity.html), views human personality in a nuanced and dynamic manner, rather than categorical and static. We see individuals as exhibiting traits such as avarice, laziness, bravery, humor, and likability to varying degrees in the tumult of daily life.

In facing the current global meta-crisis, with climate change as a major challenge, our goal is to provide a robust analytical tool. For this, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs), further explained on [this page](https://resilienceanalytics.github.io/LLM.html), to offer informed advice for our decision-making.

Our site features an extensive essay of over 560 pages, designed for analysis by LLMs, and a customized attention mechanism ([see here](https://resilienceanalytics.github.io/CustomMultiHead.html)), which improves the precision of LLMs at the expense of speed. We also offer a poetic view of human beings by connecting their characteristics ([explored here](https://resilienceanalytics.github.io/Matrix.html)), along with various tools for semantic analysis.
