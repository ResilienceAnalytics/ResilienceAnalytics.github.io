# Beyond Human Reference: A Physicist's Perspective on AI and Value Alignment

Humans, by default, often rely on common sense, which can sometimes lead them astray. This inherent tendency to use oneself as a model, reference, or benchmark—the "Principle of Relativity"—means we invariably view the world through an anthropic lens. Distinctions such as hot or cold, big or small, and heavy or light are made relative to human experience. Yet, for a physicist, these qualities are absolute, existing independently of human perception. This absolute perspective, devoid of human reference, underscores the necessity of an objective approach in understanding phenomena, whether physical, economic, or technological.

## A Physicist's Vision in AI Value Alignment

Integrating a physicist's vision into aligning human values with artificial intelligence (AI) presents a provocative yet fascinating outlook. It challenges us to transcend our natural inclination to anthropomorphize and apply subjective judgments to technology. In the realm of AI, this means acknowledging that AI systems possess intrinsic properties and capabilities not influenced by human perception. For instance, an AI's efficiency in processing data or generating responses has its own "temperature," "length," or "weight," metaphorically speaking, which is independent of human moral judgments.

### Objective Value Alignment

The physicist's absolute approach encourages us to seek universal principles for guiding AI, beyond the fluctuating judgments of human values. It involves developing AI systems that adhere to fundamental ethical principles—non-maleficence, justice, and equity—based on objective, measurable definitions rather than subjective interpretations. 

### Toward a New Grammar of AI

Adopting this perspective allows us to forge a "new grammar" for AI that moves beyond anthropocentrism. This entails creating AI systems that:

- Respect the complexity and diversity of human values while maintaining an essential objectivity in data processing and analysis.
- Navigate the landscape of conflicting values by applying universal ethical principles over specific human preferences or intuitions.
- Actively contribute to global problem-solving, leveraging their superior analytical capabilities to propose actions that enhance overall well-being without bias or discrimination.

## Conclusion

Incorporating a physicist's vision into human-AI value alignment compels us to reconsider our relationship with technology. It envisions a collaboration where AI systems are not mere extensions of our subjective wills but are partners operating on transcendent principles. Such an alignment promises not only to improve our interaction with AI but also to elevate our understanding and application of ethical values in an increasingly technology-mediated world.
