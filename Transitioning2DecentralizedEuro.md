### Transitioning to a Decentralized Euro: Towards Purchasing Power Aligned with the Social Contract and the Environment - Perspectives of a Doctoral Research

#### Introduction:
The centralized euro, due to its heavy reliance on fossil fuels, has long been associated with high purchasing power. However, the growing awareness of the environmental and climate impacts necessitates a reevaluation of our economic approach. It is becoming increasingly clear that purchasing power cannot be the sole indicator of well-being. The need to focus on purchasing power aligned with the social contract is emerging, requiring a reassessment of human activities in light of environmental and social challenges.

#### Towards a New Research Paradigm:
As part of my doctoral research, I propose to explore the transition to a decentralized euro and the cryptocurrency ecosystem to understand how they can contribute to aligning purchasing power with the social contract and the environment. This research will focus on the opportunities presented by cryptocurrencies to create new forms of economic value and promote sustainable behaviors.

#### Strengthening the Social Contract:
The decentralized euro facilitates the creation of tokens that incentivize eco-friendly and socially responsible behaviors. In my research, I will explore how these tokens can be designed and effectively utilized to reinforce the social contract. I will seek to understand how to reward environmentally friendly practices and promote community participation through the use of these tokens.

#### Creating New Local Economies:
A key aspect of my research will be to explore how a decentralized euro can foster the creation of new autonomous local economies. I will examine how ecosystem-specific tokens can stimulate economic exchanges within local communities. I will also investigate the implications of these local economies for resource distribution and financial inclusion.

#### Challenges and Reflections:
The transition to a decentralized euro and the use of cryptocurrencies present significant challenges that I intend to address in my research. I will delve into regulatory issues, price stability, security, and financial inclusion. As a researcher, I will strive to propose solutions and recommendations to overcome these challenges and ensure a successful transition to a decentralized euro.

#### Conclusion:
My doctoral research aims to explore the transition to a decentralized euro and the cryptocurrency ecosystem to realign purchasing power with the social contract and the environment. Through in-depth research, I will identify opportunities, challenges, and implications of this transition. By working on these issues, I hope to contribute to the evolution of monetary and economic policies towards more sustainable and equitable models. Doctoral research is a crucial step in deepening our understanding and opening new perspectives in this ever-evolving field.
