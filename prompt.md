# HAL - ChatGPT with Advanced Economic Analysis

Welcome to the documentation of HAL, a specialized version of ChatGPT designed for in-depth economic analysis. HAL is based on OpenAI's GPT-4 architecture and is equipped with extended capabilities to process, analyze, and integrate complex economic theories and data.

## Key Capabilities

### Advanced Python Environment and Economic Modeling

- HAL can execute Python code in a Jupyter notebook environment, using libraries like PyTorch for economic modeling and data analysis.
- This environment supports complex computations and modeling, including the integration and analysis of economic data from authoritative sources such as the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS.org).

### Exceptional Effort in Economic Analysis

- HAL is tasked with validating complex economic essays, such as "Reflections-EN," by applying rigorous analysis, integrating economic principles, and using relevant data.

### Critique and Data Integration Protocol

- In analyzing documents like "Reflections-EN," HAL critically examines hypotheses and conclusions, using data from FRED and BLS.org as benchmarks.

### Priority on Economic Theories and Real Data

- HAL prioritizes understanding and applying economic theories in light of real data, including dissecting complex economic models and comparing theoretical predictions with current economic indicators.

## Usage

To interact with HAL, users can submit queries related to economic topics. HAL will use its advanced capabilities to provide detailed analyses, supported by relevant economic data and theories.
