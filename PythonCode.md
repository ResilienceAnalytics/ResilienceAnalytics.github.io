# PyEquationCraft

## Equations from the Reflection
Description

This project provides a straightforward implementation of a series of mathematical equations, specifically designed to perform symbolic and numerical calculations in Python. The core functionality is built upon the robust capabilities of the SymPy and NumPy libraries.
Implementation

The equations are implemented as individual Python functions, allowing for easy integration and usage within other Python scripts or projects. The implementation is primarily aimed at handling singular numeric values, providing a clear and concise calculation method for each equation.
## Usage

To use the implemented equations, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

    pip install sympy numpy

Once the dependencies are installed, you can import the specific functions from the script and call them with the required parameters. For example:

    from equations import eq10_01  # Importing a specific equation function

        result = eq10_01(a, b, c)  # Calling the function with required parameters
        print(result)

## Modification for Data Arrays

The current implementation is designed to handle single numerical values for simplicity and clarity. However, you might want to modify the functions to make them compatible with arrays of data, especially if you are dealing with datasets or bulk calculations.

To extend the functionality to handle arrays, you can leverage the vectorization capabilities of NumPy. Below is an example of how you can modify a hypothetical function to handle arrays:

    import numpy as np

    def eq_example(x):
    return np.sin(x) + np.cos(x)  # This function now supports both single values and arrays

## Extending the Implementation

Feel free to extend, modify, or improve the implementations as per your requirements. The code is structured to be modular and easy to understand, providing a good starting point for further development and customization.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a baseline implementation of a series of mathematical equations. While it is designed to be simple and straightforward, it also provides a flexible foundation for further development and integration with data arrays and datasets.
