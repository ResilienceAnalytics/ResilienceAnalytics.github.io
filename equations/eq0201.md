# Equation 02-01 Implementation

## Overview
This section provides a detailed implementation and explanation of the equation 02-01 from the field of Econophysics. The equation is implemented in Python, and this documentation aims to guide users through its usage.

## Equation
The equation is defined as follows:

$$
M = n \cdot u
$$

## Python Implementation
```python
def eq0201(n, u):
    """
    Calculate M based on the equation M = n * u

    Parameters:
    n (float): The value of n
    u (float): The value of u

    Returns:
    float: The calculated value of M
    """
    M = n * u
    return M
```

## Usage

To use the `eq0201` function, you need to provide the values of `n` and `u` as arguments. The function will then calculate and return the value of `M`.

## Example

```python
n_value = 10  # replace with your value
u_value = 5   # replace with your value
result = eq0201(n_value, u_value)
print("The calculated value of M is:", result)
```

In this example, we have defined `n` as 10 and `u` as 5. The function `eq0201` calculates the value of `M` based on the equation \( M = n \cdot u \), and the result is printed to the console.
