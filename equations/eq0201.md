# Equation 02-01 Implementation

**Eq02-01:**

$$M = n \cdot u$$

**Page number:**

$$p.171$$



**Usage Instructions:**
To use the `eq0201` function, provide the values of `n` and `u` as arguments. The function will calculate and return the value of `M`.

**Code Example:**
```python
n = 5
u = 10
M = eq0201(n, u)
print("The value of M is:", M)

print("The calculated value of M is:", result)
```

In this example, we have defined `n` as 10 and `u` as 5. The function `eq0201` calculates the value of `M` based on the equation $$M = n \cdot u$$, and the result is printed to the console.
