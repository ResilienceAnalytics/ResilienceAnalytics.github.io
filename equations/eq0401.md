# Equation 04-01 Implementation
## Overview

This section provides a detailed implementation and explanation of the equation 04-01 from the field of Physics. The equation describes the relationship between angular velocity, change in length, and change in time. This documentation aims to guide users through its usage.
Equation

The equation is defined as follows:
ω=−dldt
ω=−dtdl​

## Python Implementation

    def eq0401(dl, dt):
    
    Calculate omega based on the equation omega = -dl/dt

    Parameters:
    dl (float): The change in length
    dt (float): The change in time

    Returns:
    float: The calculated value of omega
    
    if dt == 0:
        raise ValueError("dt cannot be 0 as it would result in division by zero.")
    omega = -dl / dt
    return omega

## Usage

To use the eq0401 function, you need to provide the values of dl (change in length) and dt (change in time) as arguments. The function will then calculate and return the value of ωω.

## Example

dl_value = 5  # replace with your value
dt_value = 2  # replace with your value
result = eq0401(dl_value, dt_value)
print("The calculated value of omega is:", result)

In this example, we have defined dl as 5 and dt as 2. The function eq0401 calculates the value of ωω based on the equation ω=−dldtω=−dtdl​, and the result is printed to the console.
