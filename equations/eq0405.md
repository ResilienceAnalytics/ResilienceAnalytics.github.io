# Equation 04-05 Implementation
## Overview

This section provides a detailed implementation and explanation of the equation 04-05 from the field of Physics. The equation describes the relationship between a force, a constant, and angular acceleration. This documentation aims to guide users through its usage.
## Equation

The equation is defined as follows:

FP=cP⋅γω
FP​=cP​⋅γω​

## Python Implementation

    def eq0405(c_P, gamma_omega):
    
    Calculate F_P based on the equation F_P = c_P * gamma_omega

    Parameters:
    c_P (float): The constant value c_P
    gamma_omega (float): The angular acceleration gamma_omega

    Returns:
    float: The calculated value of F_P
    
    F_P = c_P * gamma_omega
    return F_P

## Usage

To use the eq0405 function, you need to provide the values of c_P (the constant) and gamma_omega (the angular acceleration) as arguments. The function will then calculate and return the value of FPFP​.

## Example

  c_P_value = 10  # replace with your value
  gamma_omega_value = 5   # replace with your value
  result = eq0405(c_P_value, gamma_omega_value)
  print("The calculated value of F_P is:", result)

In this example, we have defined c_P as 10 and gamma_omega as 5. The function eq0405 calculates the value of FPFP​ based on the equation FP=cP⋅γωFP​=cP​⋅γω​, and the result is printed to the console.
