# Equation 03-01 Implementation

$$ \mathrm{d}R_m > 0 \tag{3-01} $$


## Page Number
$$p.187$$

## Overview

This section provides a detailed implementation and explanation of the equation 03-01 from the field of Econophysics. The equation represents a condition, and this documentation aims to guide users through its usage.

## Equation

The condition is defined as follows:
dRm>0
dRm​>0
Python Implementation

```python

def check_dRm_condition(dR_m):
    """
    Check if the condition dR_m > 0 is satisfied.

    Parameters:
    dR_m (float): The value of dR_m

    Returns:
    bool: True if the condition is satisfied, False otherwise
    """
    return dR_m > 0
```
## Usage

To use the check_dRm_condition function, you need to provide the value of dR_m as an argument. The function will then check if the condition dRm>0dRm​>0 is satisfied.
Example

```python

dR_m_value = 5  # replace with your value
result = check_dRm_condition(dR_m_value)
print("Is the condition dR_m > 0 satisfied?", result)
```
In this example, we have defined dR_m as 5. The function check_dRm_condition checks if the condition dRm>0dRm​>0 is satisfied, and the result is printed to the console.
