# Equation 04-02 Implementation
## Overview

This section provides a detailed implementation and explanation of the equation 04-02 from the field of Physics. The equation describes the relationship between angular velocity, change in pressure, and change in time. This documentation aims to guide users through its usage.
Equation

The equation is defined as follows:
ϖ=dpdt
ϖ=dtdp​

## Python Implementation


  def eq0402(dp, dt):
    """
    Calculate varpi based on the equation varpi = dp/dt

    Parameters:
    dp (float): The change in pressure
    dt (float): The change in time

    Returns:
    float: The calculated value of varpi
    """
    if dt == 0:
        raise ValueError("dt cannot be 0 as it would result in division by zero.")
    varpi = dp / dt
    return varpi

## Usage

To use the eq0402 function, you need to provide the values of dp (change in pressure) and dt (change in time) as arguments. The function will then calculate and return the value of ϖϖ.
## Example



  dp_value = 5  # replace with your value
  dt_value = 2  # replace with your value
  result = eq0402(dp_value, dt_value)
  print("The calculated value of varpi is:", result)

In this example, we have defined dp as 5 and dt as 2. The function eq0402 calculates the value of ϖϖ based on the equation ϖ=dpdtϖ=dtdp​, and the result is printed to the console.
