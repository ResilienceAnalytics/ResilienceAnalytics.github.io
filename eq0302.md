# Equation 03-02 Implementation
## Overview

This section provides a detailed implementation and explanation of the equation 03-02 from the field of Econophysics. The equation represents a condition, and this documentation aims to guide users through its usage.
Equation

The condition is defined as follows:
dRmi>0
dRmi​​>0
Python Implementation


    def eq0302(dR_m_i):
    
    Check if the condition dR_m_i > 0 is satisfied.

    Parameters:
    dR_m_i (float): The value of dR_m_i

    Returns:
    bool: True if the condition is satisfied, False otherwise
    
    return dR_m_i > 0

## Usage

To use the eq0302 function, you need to provide the value of dR_m_i as an argument. 
The function will then check if the condition dRmi>0 is satisfied.

## Example

  dR_m_i_value = 5  # replace with your value
  result = eq0302(dR_m_i_value)
  print("Is the condition dR_m_i > 0 satisfied?", result)

In this example, we have defined dR_m_i as 5. The function eq0302 checks if the condition dRmi>0dRmi​​>0 is satisfied, and the result is printed to the console.
