# Equation 04-06 Implementation
## Overview

This section provides a detailed implementation and explanation of the equation 04-06 from the field of Physics. The equation describes the relationship between a force, a constant, and angular acceleration. This documentation aims to guide users through its usage.
## Equation

The equation is defined as follows:
FA=−cA⋅γϖ
FA​=−cA​⋅γϖ​

## Python Implementation



    def eq0406(c_A, gamma_varpi):
    
    Calculate F_A based on the equation F_A = -c_A * gamma_varpi

    Parameters:
    c_A (float): The constant value c_A
    gamma_varpi (float): The angular acceleration gamma_varpi

    Returns:
    float: The calculated value of F_A
    
    F_A = -c_A * gamma_varpi
    return F_A

## Usage

To use the eq0406 function, you need to provide the values of c_A (the constant) and gamma_varpi (the angular acceleration) as arguments. The function will then calculate and return the value of FAFA​.
## Example

  c_A_value = 10  # replace with your value
  gamma_varpi_value = 5   # replace with your value
  result = eq0406(c_A_value, gamma_varpi_value)
  print("The calculated value of F_A is:", result)

In this example, we have defined c_A as 10 and gamma_varpi as 5. The function eq0406 calculates the value of FAFA​ based on the equation FA=−cA⋅γϖFA​=−cA​⋅γϖ​, and the result is printed to the console.
