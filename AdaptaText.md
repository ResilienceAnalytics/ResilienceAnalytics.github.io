# AdaptaText: Text Classification with Custom Attention Mechanisms

## Overview
AdaptaText is a script that facilitates the training and evaluation of a text classification model using TensorFlow. It leverages both built-in and custom attention mechanisms, configurable through command-line arguments. The script supports various settings for attention mechanisms, training configurations, and evaluation metrics.

## Features
- Use of TensorFlow's standard `MultiHeadAttention` and custom multi-head attention mechanisms.
- Configurable model parameters through command-line arguments.
- Supports different attention types including scaled dot product, cosine similarity, and L1/L2 norm attention.
- Extensible to include other types of custom attention mechanisms.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- `argparse` module

## Usage
The script can be run with various command-line options to customize the model's training and evaluation. Here are a few examples:

```bash
# Run with default parameters
python AdaptaText.py

# Custom batch size and number of epochs
python AdaptaText.py --batch-size 64 --epochs 20

# Use a custom attention mechanism with increased embedding dimension
python AdaptaText.py --use-custom-attention --embed-dim 256 --attention-types cosine_similarity l1_norm

# Use standard attention with specific number of heads and dropout rate
python AdaptaText.py --use-standard-attention --num-heads 4 --dropout-rate 0.3

# Enable both standard and custom attention mechanisms
python AdaptaText.py --use-standard-attention --use-custom-attention --attention-types scaled_dot_product l2_norm FIXME
```

## Development
The script is structured to define and parse command-line arguments, prepare datasets, build and train the model, and evaluate its performance. Custom attention mechanisms are defined in separate classes, allowing easy modifications and extensions.

### Attention Mechanisms
Custom attention mechanisms are implemented in the `CustomMultiheadAttention` class, which can be configured to use different attention types per head. This flexibility allows experimenting with various attention strategies to enhance model performance on specific tasks.

## Example Code
The following Python code snippet shows how to initialize and use the `CustomMultiheadAttention`:

```python
# Example initialization of CustomMultiheadAttention
custom_attention = CustomMultiheadAttention(
    embed_dim=512

, num_heads=4,
    attention_types=['scaled_dot_product', 'cosine_similarity', 'l1_norm', 'l2_norm'],
    dropout=0.1
)
```

For more detailed information, refer to the inline comments in the source code. Each function and class is thoroughly documented to facilitate understanding and further development.
