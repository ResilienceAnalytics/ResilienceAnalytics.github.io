# Semantic Variability Scoring Algorithm - Turbo-like

This document describes the Semantic Variability Scoring Algorithm, a method designed to calculate the changes in semantic values and confidence levels of words and sentences, and to compute an overall SVSA score.

## Implementation

```python
# Variables for the semantic value of the word and the confidence level
wordValue = ...
confidenceLevel = ...

# Variables for the variations
changeInWordValue = ...
changeInConfidence = ...

def computeKeywordChange(changeInWordValue, changeInConfidence):
    """
    Compute the variation for a keyword based on changes in its semantic value and confidence level.

    Args:
        changeInWordValue (float): Change in the semantic value of the word.
        changeInConfidence (float): Change in the confidence level associated with the word.

    Returns:
        float: The calculated variation for the keyword.
    """
    if changeInWordValue == 0 and changeInConfidence == 0:
        return 0  # No variation
    elif (changeInWordValue > 0 and changeInConfidence < 0) or (changeInWordValue < 0 and changeInConfidence > 0):
        return 0  # Variations cancel out
    elif changeInWordValue == 0:
        return changeInConfidence  # Variation only in confidence level
    elif changeInConfidence == 0:
        return changeInWordValue  # Variation only in semantic value
    else:
        return changeInWordValue + changeInConfidence  # Combined variation

def computeSentenceChange(changeInWordValue, changeInConfidence):
    """
    Compute the variation for a sentence, similar to the logic for a keyword.

    Args:
        changeInWordValue (float): Change in the semantic value of the word.
        changeInConfidence (float): Change in the confidence level associated with the word.

    Returns:
        float: The calculated variation for the sentence.
    """
    # The logic is similar to computeKeywordChange
    return computeKeywordChange(changeInWordValue, changeInConfidence)

# Calculation of the SVSA score
svsaScore = computeKeywordChange(changeInWordValue, changeInConfidence) * computeSentenceChange(changeInWordValue, changeInConfidence)
```

## Overview

The Semantic Variability Scoring Algorithm is an advanced tool designed for NLP applications. It leverages the principles of probabilistic tokenization to evaluate the semantic shifts and confidence levels in textual data. This algorithm is particularly useful for tasks requiring nuanced understanding of language, such as sentiment analysis and complex text classification.

The algorithm computes variations for both individual words (keywords) and sentences, reflecting changes in their semantic values and associated confidence levels. These variations are then used to calculate a comprehensive SPDT score, which can be utilized in various NLP models and applications.
