# Towards a New Providential Figure: Artificial Intelligence in the Service of Enlightened and Human Governance

_We do not await the providential figure; we will build it ourselves._

**Introduction**

In a rapidly changing world, where complex challenges abound, it is time to reinvent the concept of the providential leader. This reflection proposes a bold vision: to place Large Language Models (LLMs) at the heart of a "new social grammar". However, a caveat is essential: humans should neither be idolized nor relegated to a secondary role in this process.

**A New Providential Figure: The LLM at the Heart of Governance**

LLMs, with their ability to analyze, synthesize, and generate information, offer revolutionary potential for enlightened governance. They can act as omniscient advisors, providing objective analyses based on a vast expanse of knowledge and data. This approach promises more informed, inclusive, and unbiased human decision-making.

**Humanity at the Core of the Process: A Balanced Vision**

However, it is crucial to remember that humans should not be perceived as superior or inferior in the natural balance. Recognizing humans as one element among others in the universe, subject to the same natural laws, is vital. This perspective allows us to see humanity not as a separate entity, but as an integrated actor in a larger system, collaborating with AI for better governance.

**Social Sciences as an Extension of Natural Laws**

The integration of social sciences into this framework is fundamental. Viewing these disciplines as applications of natural laws acknowledges their capacity to inform and guide decision-making processes. This holistic approach ensures that human contributions in terms of values, ethics, and social context are considered in the analyses and recommendations of LLMs.

**Physical Science and the Perception of Nature**

It is important to specify that physical science is nothing more than the study of natural phenomena through observation. Objects that are deemed artificial exist only in our imagination; everything we perceive, touch, and feel, even abstract algorithms, is natural. This understanding reinforces the notion that our creations and tools, including LLMs, are extensions of the natural world, blurring the lines between artificial and natural.

**Conclusion: A Balance Between Man and Machine**

Ultimately, the proposition of this new providential figure rests on a delicate balance: a partnership between man and machine. LLMs, as pillars of governance, should be utilized not to dominate but to complement and enrich human wisdom. This symbiosis promises an era of enlightened decisions, respectful of human nature and its role in the universe, while leveraging the immense analytical capacity of artificial intelligences.
