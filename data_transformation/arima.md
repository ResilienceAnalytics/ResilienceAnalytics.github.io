# Time Series Data Segmentation and ARIMA Modeling Script

The Time Series Data Segmentation and ARIMA Modeling Script is a Python utility designed for handling time series data, particularly focusing on segmenting the data based on specific breakpoints and applying ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling to each segment. The script also includes functionality for data visualization, allowing users to see the original data and ARIMA model predictions side by side.

## Features

- **Multiple File Format Support**: The script can load data from CSV, ODS, and XLSX files.
- **Data Segmentation**: Data is segmented based on user-defined breakpoints.
- **ARIMA Modeling**: Each data segment is modeled using the ARIMA model, a popular approach for time series forecasting.
- **Visualization**: Generates plots to compare original data with ARIMA model predictions.

## Usage

To use the script, execute it from the command line with the following syntax:

```bash
python script.py <data_file_path> <breakpoints_file_path> <data_column_name>
```

- `<data_file_path>`: Path to the input data file (CSV, ODS, or XLSX).
- `<breakpoints_file_path>`: Path to the file containing the breakpoints for data segmentation.
- `<data_column_name>`: Name of the column in the data file that you want to model.

## Script Functions

- `load_and_convert_data(file_path)`: Loads data from the specified file path and converts it to ODS format if necessary.
- `segment_data(data, breakpoints)`: Divides the data into segments based on the provided breakpoints.
- `fit_arima_to_segments(segments, data_column, order=(1, 1, 1))`: Fits an ARIMA model to each data segment.
- `plot_segments(segments, models)`: Creates plots to visualize data segments before and after ARIMA processing.
- `main(data_file, breakpoints_file, data_column)`: The main function that orchestrates the data loading, segmentation, ARIMA modeling, and visualization.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Pandas library
- Statsmodels library (for ARIMA modeling)
- Matplotlib library (for data visualization)
- openpyxl and odfpy libraries (for handling XLSX and ODS files, respectively)

Ensure that these libraries are installed in your Python environment to use the script effectively.
