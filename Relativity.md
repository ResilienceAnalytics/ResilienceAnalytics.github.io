# PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY

Imagine a sailor positioned on the crow's nest of a sailing ship moving at a constant speed in a straight line parallel to the coast. By chance, the sailor drops a marlinspike. Then:

1. A helicopter pilot, having positioned his aircraft directly above the mast and maintaining that position, watches the event unfold. He notices nothing unusual, always seeing the tool in the same position near the mast and concludes it can be represented by a point (dimension 0);
2. A sailor on the deck of the ship observes the scene. He sees the marlinspike fall to the base of the mast in a straight line (dimension 1);
3. A mermaid, sunbathing on the shore, also watches the phenomenon. She notices that the tool also lands at the foot of the mast but follows a simple parabolic curve (dimension 2);
4. A Martian, examining our planet, observes the scene with an eye glued to the eyepiece of a telescope. She notes that the marlinspike hits the deck at the foot of the mast and that the traveled trajectory is described by a complicated curve (dimension 3).

Moreover, depending on the position of the sailor on the deck, the mermaid on the shore, and Mars in its orbit, different characteristics of the curves are induced. Thus:
- The sailor always sees a straight segment, but its length varies;
- The mermaid always perceives a parabola, but its shape changes;
- The extraterrestrial always observes a curve of the same appearance but with different contours.

However, the lengths of the different paths traveled are dissimilar according to the observers, despite the duration of the phenomenon being identical for each. The path seen:
- by the helicopter pilot, is of zero length;
- by the sailor, is a straight segment whose length varies depending on his position on the ship;
- by the mermaid, is longer than that designated by the sailor;
- by the Martian, is even longer.

From this, it follows that, for each observer, the speed of the mobile (marlinspike) is different since the fall is unique. In conclusion, the aphorism "everyone sees noon at his door" perfectly summarizes the relativity of phenomena according to the characteristics of the employed reference frame (position of the origin and direction of the axes). Knowing that nothing is ubiquitous and thus no object can travel distinct paths, then all the aforementioned observers either are mistaken or tell the truth. Before the court of reason, each can swear by their gods that they have seen and rightly observed what they have reported. From this enumeration, it is deduced that each situation is a particular case of observation of the same phenomenon, as each observer chooses their own reference frame; two observers cannot be in the same place simultaneously. Consequently, two observers never see exactly the same thing. Therefore, it must be admitted that visualizing a trajectory taken and the speed with which it is traveled makes no sense unless the position of the observer is specified, that is, to know the reference frame in which the followed itinerary is located. To maintain, like Thomas the Doubter, to believe only what one sees is thus the shortest path to error. Indeed, it is then to define oneself as a reference point, to choose oneself as the origin of the reference frame and, consequently, to ignore others who have a different reference frame.

Every individual sees the sun rise in the east, be at zenith in the middle of the day, and set in the west. This sequence of situations is absolutely indisputable. However, the conclusion drawn from it, "the Sun revolves," is relatively accurate or false, depending on the chosen reference frame:
- this assertion is admissible only if the adopted reference frame is the Earth and only that;
- it is erroneous, that is, false, for any other chosen reference frame, especially for one in which the Sun is taken as the origin.

The poet (Pierre Corneille â€“ Le Cid) who wrote "This obscure clarity that falls from the stars..." could very well have stated that clarity rises and not falls, and no one could have contested this assertion. It depends only on the place where the observer is situated and the direction in which they are looking.

What has been presented for physics applies in the same way to Economics. We know that the development of any Product requires the existence of a relatively high number of manufacturers placed chronologically one after the other. Three of these manufacturers have been conventionally designated Seller, Transformer, and Buyer, as indicated above, knowing that the Buyer can be a final consumer who uses the considered Product. If the final consumer is perceived as the observer of an event (use of a Product), then they analyze:
- Utility increasing during the different phases of production;
- Utility decreasing during its use by themselves.

But each manufacturer, whatever it may be, presents itself as a consumer concerning the previous manufacturer, that is, as a user and is observed as a supplier with respect to the following manufacturer. Then, every manufacturer presents itself as a Transformer for the previous manufacturer and a Seller for the next. Thus, if the Transformer is considered as the observer of an event (elaboration of a Product), then they consider:
- Utility increasing during the elaboration of the Product by the Seller;
- Utility decreasing during the fabrication of the Product by themselves;
- Utility increasing during the use of the Product by the Buyer.

Indeed, the more the Buyer uses the Product, the quicker it will be worn out, and the more quickly a new exemplar will need to be manufactured.

As every manufacturer plays indifferently, but sequentially, each of the three roles, first Buyer, then Transformer, and finally Seller concerning the others, the three situations listed above are true simultaneously but only in function of the observer's position. The sense (increase or decrease) of the variation of Utility during the fabrication of a Product is thus relative to the observer's position, in accordance with the General Principle of Relativity. This is an additional argument to consider the absolute inviolability of natural laws and that the Economy is, obviously, rigorously and totally subject to them. It must be added that during negotiations between the Seller and the Transformer on one hand and between the Transformer and the Buyer on the other hand, the Utility of the Product does not vary and therefore remains constant.

In conclusion, it is possible to assert that:
- an observer can only witness an event if they are located outside the system, that is, in a different reference frame from that of the event;
- an observer can notice nothing and realize nothing if they are placed in the same reference frame (or an identical reference frame) as what they observe.

This is why the helicopter pilot sees nothing particular (dimension 0) since it was specified that he moved in accordance with the ship (identical reference frame) to maintain himself directly above the mast.
