# Custom Multi-Head Attention Model Documentation

[here](https://github.com/ResilienceAnalytics/Python-Code/blob/main/CustomMultiheadAttention.py){: .btn .btn-purple }

## Overview
This documentation provides an overview and guidance on how to use the custom multi-head attention model implemented in TensorFlow. The model is designed for natural language processing tasks and leverages a custom implementation of the multi-head attention mechanism, which is a crucial component in Transformer models. The primary application of this model is for text classification tasks.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- OS, RE, String (standard Python libraries)

## Components

### CustomMultiheadAttention Class
- **Purpose**: Implements a custom multi-head attention mechanism.
- **Arguments**:
  - `embed_dim`: Size of the embedding dimension.
  - `num_heads`: Number of attention heads. The `embed_dim` must be divisible by `num_heads`.
  - `dropout` (optional): Dropout rate. Default is 0.0.
- **Functions**:
  - `split_heads`: Splits the last dimension of the tensor into `(num_heads, depth)`.
  - `call`: Processes the input through the multi-head attention mechanism.

### Dataset Preparation
- **Configuration**: Sets the path for the dataset directory and prepares the training, validation, and test datasets using TensorFlow's `text_dataset_from_directory` method.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - A custom standardization function `custom_standardization` is defined to lowercase and remove HTML tags and punctuation from the text data.

### Model Construction
- **Embedding Layer**: Converts word indices to dense vectors of fixed size.
- **CustomMultiheadAttention Layer**: Applies the custom multi-head attention mechanism.
- **GlobalAveragePooling1D**: Reduces the dimensionality of the vectors by averaging over the sequence length.
- **Dropout Layer**: Used for regularization.
- **Dense Layer**: Final layer for classification.

### Compilation and Training
- The model is compiled using the binary cross-entropy loss (suitable for binary classification tasks) and the Adam optimizer.
- The training process involves fitting the model on the training dataset and validating it on the validation dataset.

### Evaluation and Visualization
- The model's performance is evaluated on the test dataset.
- Training and validation loss and accuracy are visualized using Matplotlib to understand the model's learning over epochs.

## Usage Example
```python
# Model instantiation
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Embedding(max_features + 1, embedding_dim),
    CustomMultiheadAttention(embed_dim=512, num_heads=8),
    layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    layers.Dropout(0.2),
    layers.Dense(1)])

# Model compilation
model.compile(loss=losses.BinaryCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              optimizer='adam',
              metrics=tf.metrics.BinaryAccuracy(threshold=0.0))

# Model training
history = model.fit(train_ds, validation_data=val_ds, epochs=epochs)

# Model evaluation
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(test_ds)
```

## Visualization
```python
# Plotting the training and validation loss and accuracy
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
# ... (loss plot code) ...
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
# ... (accuracy plot code) ...
plt.show()
```

## Note
- The model's performance and effectiveness can vary based on the dataset and specific task.
- Fine-tuning and adjusting hyperparameters may be necessary for optimal results.
