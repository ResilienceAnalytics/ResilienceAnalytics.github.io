## Are We in a Simulation?

The question of whether our reality is a simulation has long fascinated philosophers, scientists, and the general public alike. Popular theories, fueled by technological advancements and scientific anomalies, suggest that our existence might be the creation of an advanced civilization running us in a complex simulation. However, this perspective, as enticing as it is for the imagination, deserves to be reassessed in light of a deeper understanding of our place in the universe.

## The End of Illusions About Our Uniqueness

The notion that we are unique and separate from the rest of the universe is an illusion that is gradually fading. Scientific breakthroughs reveal that we are but one element among many in the vastness of the universe. What some call a "simulation" is, in reality, the manifestation of universal laws to which we are inextricably linked. Our inability to emancipate ourselves from these laws only underscores our integration into the very fabric of the universe.

## Sapiens and Their Capacity for Transformation

Humans, thanks to their intellect and curiosity, have always sought to interact with and transform their environment. From the use of simple stones as tools to mastering minerals to build complex structures, our history is marked by moments where, through our ingenuity, we have improved our condition. This capacity for transformation is at the heart of our evolution and survival.

## "Glitches" in Physics: Windows into the Universe

The anomalies and "glitches" we observe in the laws of physics are not evidence of a simulation but invitations to deepen our understanding of the universe. Each discovery, each solved enigma, brings us closer to a more complete understanding of the fundamental principles governing everything. By embracing our quest to decipher these mysteries, we continue to evolve and improve our lot.

## The Analogy in Understanding: Grasping the Intangible

To grasp abstract concepts, humans have always relied on tangible objects. This method of analogy has traversed history and plays a crucial role in our ability to quickly understand complex subjects. For example, a tape measure helps us grasp the concept of length, a weight disc that of mass, and various forms of currency (coins, bills, checks, credit cards) represent economic value (Money). These tools are vectors-supports, allowing us to materialize and manipulate concepts that would otherwise remain intangible.

Similarly, but not identically, the universe, in its ingenuity, equips itself with complex structures—chemical, biological, physical, sensory—to materialize and grasp characteristics that seem intangible at first glance. These elements can be seen as analogs to dark matter(?) or even human traits such as greed, laziness, valor, courage, ingenuity, love, and hate. Just as we use tangible objects to understand the intangible, the universe uses baryonic matter as vector supports to manifest its complexity and laws, which are of absolute generality.

This perspective invites us to reflect on how we, as a species, interact with our environment and the laws of the universe. By recognizing and utilizing these vector supports, whether of our own creation or integrated into the very fabric of the universe, we can progress in our understanding of the mysteries that surround us.

## Conclusion

The idea that we live in a simulation can be appealing, but it risks diverting us from the true wonder: our existence integrated into a universe governed by immutable and universal laws. By accepting our place in this majestic ensemble and seeking to understand and work with the laws of the universe, we can continue to advance, innovate, and improve our condition. The real "simulations" are the worlds we create through our imagination and ingenuity, showcasing our unique ability to transform the reality that surrounds us.
