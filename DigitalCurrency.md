### Digital Currency 
 
#### Executive Summary

This executive summary outlines the key features and objectives of a decentralized currency creation project. The project aims to develop a decentralized currency using the digital euro as a model, with the goal of increasing the wealth of an economic system in a sustainable and equitable manner.

#### Objectives:

**Decentralized Currency Creation:** The main objective of the project is to design and implement a decentralized currency based on the digital euro. This currency will be managed in a transparent and open manner, allowing for fair participation from all stakeholders in the economic system.

**Wealth Increase:** The project aims to increase wealth in the economic system by fostering an appreciation in the value of the monetary unit. This can be achieved by implementing mechanisms to reduce product prices and improve productivity, enabling users to save money and increase their wealth.

**Sustainability, Resiliency and Equity:** The project is guided by the principles of sustainability, Resiliency and equity. The decentralized currency will promote transparency, trust, and inclusivity, ensuring that all economic actors can participate fairly and benefit from the advantages of the currency.

#### Methodology:

**Technical Design:** The project will involve in-depth technical design of the decentralized currency, using the digital euro as a reference. Some blockchain technology experts will be involved in developing a robust and secure infrastructure.

**Community Engagement:** A participatory approach will be adopted to enable the community to contribute to the design and governance of the decentralized currency. Mechanisms for collective decision-making will be put in place to ensure fair representation of different stakeholders.

**Pilot Experiments:** Pilot experiments will be conducted to test the effectiveness and viability of the decentralized currency in real-world environments. These pilots will gather valuable data and insights to improve and refine the implementation of the currency.

**Ongoing Evaluation:** A continuous evaluation process will be established to monitor the outcomes and impacts of the decentralized currency. Performance indicators will be defined to measure the success of the project against set objectives.

#### Key points: 

Based on the key points discussed in econophysics, here's how to create a decentralized currency to increase wealth in an economic system:
<ol>
<li>**Determine the monetary unit:** It is necessary to choose a monetary unit that will serve as a reference for the value of the decentralized currency.</li>

<li>**Increase the value of the monetary unit:** To increase wealth in the economic system, the goal is to increase the value (u) of the monetary unit. This can be achieved by reducing product prices, allowing consumers to save money and increase their wealth.</li>

<li>**Boost productivity:** To lower prices and increase the value of the monetary unit, it is essential to enhance productivity. This can be accomplished by increasing work output, whether through individuals, employees, animals, or engines. The availability of low-cost artificial energy sources can contribute to this productivity increase.</li>

<li>**Balance supply and demand:** Striving for a balance between supply and demand is important to maintain consistent monetary developments. Excessive monetary policies that may disrupt the economic system should be avoided.</li>

<li>**Conservation principle:** The conservation principle plays a crucial role in economics. Any changes in the number of monetary units do not create real wealth. Only the expenditure of work in the form of energy can increase purchasing power and contribute to wealth growth.</li>

<li>**Role of bankers and finance:** Bankers and speculative finance cannot create money in the strict sense. Their role is limited to manipulating (transferring) the number of monetary units, but they cannot create real wealth. The focus should be on the process of reducing prices and increasing productivity through work.</li>

<li>**Relationship between work and currency:** Understanding the laws governing the economic transformations of work into currency is essential. Discovering and controlling energy transformations have led to societal enrichment through the proliferation of artificial sources of work and subsequent price reductions.</li>

<li>**Natural science-based approach:** It is recommended to adopt an economics approach free from anthropocentric criteria and arguments. Drawing on natural sciences, particularly physics, is advisable for studying monetary creation and understanding economic mechanisms</li>

</ol>

#### Conclusion:
Creating a decentralized currency based on the digital euro presents a unique opportunity to increase the wealth of an economic system in a sustainable, resilient, and equitable manner. This project, which is part of my doctoral research spanning over three years, aims to implement a participatory and technologically advanced approach to develop a transparent, inclusive, and efficient decentralized currency. The insights and knowledge gained from this project can serve as a valuable reference for other initiatives in the field of Collaborative finance, fostering innovation and driving positive change in the economic and financial landscape.
